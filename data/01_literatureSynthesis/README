README for table-literature-survey

The CSV file table-literature-survey.csv contains information on seed bag burial and seed addition experiments. Columns are:

pubDate: year of publication
firstAuthor: last name of first firstAuthor
genus: genus name of the species being studied; if NA, the authors conducted experiments with more than one species
species: species name of species being studied; if NA, the authors conducted experiments with more than one species
experiment: identifies study as a seed bag burial or seed addition experiment
totalMonths: length of the experiment in months, from when seeds were buried in bags or plots until the last bag was unearthed or last seedling census
censusNumber: for seed bag burial experiments, we tallied the number of censuses as the number of times that seed bags were unearthed for counts of seeds and/or seedlings; for seed addition experiments, we tallied the number of censuses as the number of times that seed addition plots were censused for seedlings.
repNumber: number of experimental replicates per census; for example, if 10 seed bags were unearthed per census, repNumber=10; if 10 plots are surveyed per census, repNumber=10
seedNumber: number of seeds added to each seed bag or to each plot
germination: note on whether germination was estimated as constant or age-dependent; values are either constant, age, unestimated or NA; unestimated if the authors did not use the experiment for the estimate, NA if I was unable to determine how they obtained the estimate
survival: note on whether seed mortality/survival was estimated as constant or age-dependent; values are either constant or age, unestimated or NA; unestimated if the authors did not use the experiment for the estimate, NA if I was unable to determine how they obtained the estimate
isEstimationDiscrete: binary variable noting whether or not the publication estimated mortality/germination as a discrete parameter (value=yes) or a continuous parameter (value=no)
noteContinuousParameter: if 'isEstimationDiscrete' was no, notes whether germination, mortality, or both were estimated as continuous
isMortalityGerminationSeparateInModel: binary variable noting whether or not the publication included mortality/survival and germination separately in the population model 
notesOnEstimation: notes how authors in the publication estimated parameters
observationType: notes on what was counted or censused in the survey, as described in the study (note: not used in analysis for paper)
parameter: note on which parameter was estimated using the seed bag burial or seed addition experiments (note: not used in analysis for paper) 
notes: additional notes from when I surveyed the literature
doi: DOI for the study, when available; I entered NA for dissertations when I was unable to find an associated DOI
