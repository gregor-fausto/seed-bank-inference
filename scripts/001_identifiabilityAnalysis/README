# Identifiability

Identifiability was analyzed with the computer algebra system, Maxima, run from the wxMaxima interface.

## Installation

Maxima is a computer algebra system available at: https://maxima.sourceforge.io/

wxMaxima is a user interface to Maxima availabe at: https://wxmaxima-developers.github.io/wxmaxima/index.html

## Usage

# NOTE: the files that you run in Maxima WILL NOT run "as is"
# To replicate this, you will need to set the appropriate source directories in the files
# scriptDeficiencyAnalysis AND scriptFullAnalysis
# I have noted where you need to do this in each file

Exhaustive summaries for all models are contained in the folder '01_exhaustiveSummary'. Each model is summarized in an individual text file that can be read by Maxima.

Scripts to analyze and summarize each model are in the folder '02_scripts'. Output is saved in the folder '03_output'

To analyze the identifiability of an individual model in Maxima, read in a model and run the file 'scriptDeficiencyAnalysis'. 'scriptDeficiencyAnalysis' calculates the deficiency of the derivative matrix, and writes the deficiency to a text file.

To analyze the identifiability of all models in Maxima, run the file 'scriptFullAnalysis'. 'scriptFullAnalysis' reads in all the files containing exhaustive summaries of models, and applies the script in 'scriptDeficiencyAnalysis' to each.

## Summary

# NOTE: At lines 27 and 32, you may need to change the index of the variables that you want to extract
# once you have changed the directory you are running this analysis in.
# I have noted where/what you need to do in the file.

To organize the results of the identifiability analysis, run 'organizeAnalysis.R'. This will output a data frame in R.
